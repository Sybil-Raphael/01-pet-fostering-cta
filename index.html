      <h3>Why Foster a Pet?</h3>
      <p>
        Fostering gives animals a second chance at life. By opening your home, you help pets recover, learn to trust, and get ready for adoption. Fostering is rewarding and makes a real difference!

      <h3>How Fostering Helps Shelters</h3>
      <p>
        When you foster, you free up space in shelters so they can help more animals in need. Fosters provide love and care that shelters sometimes can't, making a big impact for every pet.
